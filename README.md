# bucket list

I created a website for my personal use, it is like a todo list but for a bucket list that I want to accomplish in life

theres a submit button of whatever i want for example if i want to go to paris i would simply put "go to paris" and cross it off 

i created this project becuase i wanted to get some experience with React JS.
